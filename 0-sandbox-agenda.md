# Sandxox Agenda


## Idea: Newsletter

* Task: Create a personal daily or weekly newsletter
* Prompt: “Create a personalized newsletter highlighting the most
important meetings, tasks, and deadlines from my email,
calendar, and core work tools. Summarize key industry trends or
major news I should know that could impact my business or
team. Wrap up with an inspiring quote or insight from recent
reading. Prioritize what requires my attention today, keep it
concise, and note if anything couldn’t be retrieved.”
