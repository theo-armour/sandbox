* Improving Bookmark Analyzer HTML Tool

The process went extremely well! I really liked the idea that I just chat with it in a very open, unstructured way, and try to let it do as much by itself. I correct or tweak because it keeps finding things that I hadn't thought of.

The notion of bringing all these bookmarks over to some kind of wiki-theo probably does not make sense.

A better idea might be to section by section bring things over to the Wikitheo.

Perhaps start with something like "people" and bring all the people that I have over to Wikitheo.

Then, perhaps, bring over "projects" or "topics" or "areas".

And then always keep the original file for new and different kinds of massaging.Use it as a playground for experimentation.


## Bookmarks

Saving bookmarks to GitHub as Markdown files is probably out of the question.Transporting thousands of files around GitHub takes too long.

So, I do like the idea of Markdown files so that I can use Beyond Compare and other tools to move things back and forth, but there should be a temporary solution.Done locally. So the idea would be that data is kept in a JSON file, and as and when needed, converted to Markdown.After the triage is completed, the file is turned back from Markdown into JSON.
