## Excerpt

Two universal facts about user documentation:
 Documentation is really important. We are really bad at writing it.  We don’t have good theories on what makes for useful documentation. That is except for the four document model, or Diátaxis.1 I’m glad that people use it. I’m also a little frustrated that people use it even when its inappropriate. My problem is that it’s not a universal or comprehensive model: there’s a lot of documentation people need to write that doesn’t neatly fit the model.
