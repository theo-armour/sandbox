## Excerpt

This is a multi-title review. Titles include Comstock Women, Frontier Women, and Land of Many Hands - During the last year, one of the most popular subjects among western historians has been the often overlooked role played by women during America's westward expansion and settlement. These three books bear witness to that trend. Jeffrey's book is in the forefront, for it is a revised edition of a work that first appeared in 1979. Detailing the many diverse contributions made by women on the frontier and, in the process, destroying common stereotypes, the narrative reshapes and analyzes the 'civilizing' influence women had on the West. Revised material includes coverage of African American, Hispanic, Chinese, and Native American women. The author avoids demonizing the white frontier women by providing a deeper understanding of their roles and examining the experiences of ordinary women living ordinary lives. Written in a narrative style, it is more evenhanded than most gender-directed histories. A bibliography keyed to the chapters is provided. The lives of women in Nevada's Comstock mining area, with special emphasis on Virginia City, are related in a series of 12 essays compiled by James and Raymond. The Comstock experienced a boom from 1860 to 1880 with the rapid development of a concentration of the world's richest gold and silver mines. It was an area, contrary to common belief, populated with not only miners but also a large number of women. Many insights are presented in this book that have been previously overlooked. The idea of community in a boomtown environment is examined with a perceptive eye toward the contributions made by the women. Such diverse subjects as prostitution, dope, and Chinese women are used to provide a fresh perspective on their overall influence on the society. Gender archaeology is the subject of the final essay, indicating a new resource for investigating situations hampered by an absence of written records. Considerable use is made of illustrations, maps, and statistics in the form of graphs and tables. Sigerman uses an extensive amount of primary sources and documents to relate the diverse roles of women during and after the westward migration. Most interesting are the details of day-to-day living. Branding cows, cooking with buffalo chips, building adobe homes, and even handling wagons on precipitous mountain trails are some of the activities described. Courage, determination, and optimism were required of women on the frontier, who almost constantly faced threats to their survival and that of their families. Illustrated with many archival photographs, it is not as detailed and a bit more forced than the other books on this subject. It may, however, have more appeal to the general reader. A recommended list of further reading is provided. - Fred Egloff; 188p-
