## Excerpt

UNCTAD and the Family Business Network (FBN) have joined forces to mobilize and support family firms to embrace sustainability in their business strategies. The joint Family Business for Sustainable Development (FBSD) initiative is a first-of-its-kind partnership between the UN and the global family business community.
