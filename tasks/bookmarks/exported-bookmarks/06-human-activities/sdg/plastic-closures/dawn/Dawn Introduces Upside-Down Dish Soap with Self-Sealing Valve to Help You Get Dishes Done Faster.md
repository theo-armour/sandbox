## Excerpt

Inverted bottle, no-flip cap and self-sealing valve allow for easy one-handed use of every last drop of soap Today, Dawn®, America’s #1 dish liquid*, is introducing Dawn EZ-Squeeze, a new inverted bottle with patented no-flip cap technology, enabling it to stand on its cap and dispense from the bottom with a self-sealing valve that protects against leaks. “Dish soap bottles are one of the most-used household items, so they should be easy to use – from the first drop to the last,” said Guerin McClure, Vice President, North America Dish Care at Procter  Gamble. “You’ve likely spent time shaking, flipping, and banging your dish soap bottle on the countertop in a messy attempt to make the most of every drop. With Dawn EZ-Squeeze we wanted to create a dish soap that was designed to be fast and easy, helping you get away from the sink and on with your life.” Dawn devoted more than five years, hundreds of designs, and thousands of hours of testing, in the development of Dawn EZ-Squeeze
