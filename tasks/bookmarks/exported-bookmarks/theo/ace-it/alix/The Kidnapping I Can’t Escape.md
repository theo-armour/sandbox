## Excerpt

Fifty years ago, my father’s friend was taken at gunpoint on Long Island. Then he went on with his life — and that’s the part that haunts me.

## Highlights

Highlight:Happy, well-adjusted people are all different. The traumatized are exactly alike.

Highlight:He had known something I didn’t, which is that it’s a bad question — that the thing not happening to you is never one of the options. It happened. It will never not have happened.

Highlight:When I smell the soap, my system floods with the neural surprise that I felt on that day: whatever it is that’s the opposite of trauma, that not everything is a fait accompli, that there are new experiences out there for me to have, that one day I could smell this smell enough times so that it would replace that other smell and the terrible things that happened to me that terrible day would recede, eclipsed by the wonderful and regular things that have happened to me since then — that that day would restore itself to its size, just another 24 hours, like all the other days, some of them good and some of them bad. I wanted to tell you that I still have some hope that it could happen.
