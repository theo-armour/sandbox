## Excerpt

At MONOCIRCUS Art and Design, we conceptualize, create and produce mainly 3D printed fashion jewelry in the form of 'wearable art', as well as other designer goods such as bags, clothing, homeware and toys, which are sold in our online store. MONOCIRCUS also produces works in a larger scale of interior and architectural design, art installations and public art. monocircus is founded by kazu and shing, a husband & wife team, who design and create things  as well as run everything else behind the scene amidst parenting two little boys. monocircus hopes to become a platform for creative individuals to feature their creations; an idea and design laboratory for inventing, exploring and producing; an arena for everyone to enjoy what monocircus houses.
