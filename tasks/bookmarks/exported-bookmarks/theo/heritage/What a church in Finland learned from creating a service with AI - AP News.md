## Excerpt

St. Paul’s Lutheran church in Helsinki has held the first church service in Finland created mostly by artificial intelligence. The congregation heard a dialogue between a long-haired, bearded Jesus in robes and a menacing-looking Satan in modern clothes play out on a large screen in the sanctuary. Also addressing the flock at the Tuesday evening service were avatars of the church’s pastors and a former president of Finland who died in 1986. The widely advertised experimental service drew over 120 people to the church in northeastern Helsinki, much more than on a typical weeknight. The clergy and worshippers said they enjoyed it, but agreed it wouldn’t replace services led by humans anytime soon.
