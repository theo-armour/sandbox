## Excerpt

Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; It is distinguished from other ways of addressing fundamental questions (such as mysticism, myth, or religion) by being critical and generally systematic and by its reliance on rational argument.&#91;3&#93; It involves logical analysis of language and clarification of the meaning of words and concepts.
