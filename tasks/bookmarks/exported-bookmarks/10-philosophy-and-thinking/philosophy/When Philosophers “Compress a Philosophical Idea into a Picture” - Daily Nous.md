## Excerpt

"Philosophical cartoons are treated as ephemera but they can make a great philosopher more compelling to their contemporaries. It takes skill to compress a philosophical idea into a picture that, once seen or recalled, could help an audience understand." . That's Nathan Ballantyne (ASU) in an article about the philosophical cartoons created by Roderick Chisholm.
