## Excerpt

The CRAAP test is a test to check the objective reliability of information sources across academic disciplines. CRAAP is an acronym for Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose.&#91;1&#93; Due to a vast number of sources existing online, it can be difficult to tell whether these sources are trustworthy to use as tools for research. The CRAAP test aims to make it easier for educators and students to determine if their sources can be trusted. By employing the test while evaluating sources, a researcher can reduce the likelihood of using unreliable information. The CRAAP test, developed by Sarah Blakeslee&#91;2&#93; and her team of librarians at California State University, Chico (CSU Chico),&#91;1&#93; is used mainly by higher education librarians at universities. It is one of various approaches to source criticism.
