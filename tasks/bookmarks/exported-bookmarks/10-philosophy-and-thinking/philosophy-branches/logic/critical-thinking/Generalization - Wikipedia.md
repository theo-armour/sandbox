## Excerpt

A generalization is a form of abstraction whereby common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims.&#91;1&#93; Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences (particularly in logic, mathematics and science), where the process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation.
