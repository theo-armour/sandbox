## Excerpt

Critical thinking is the analysis of available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments in order to form a judgement by the application of rational, skeptical, and unbiased analyses and evaluation.&#91;1&#93; The application of critical thinking includes self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective habits of the mind,&#91;2&#93; thus a critical thinker is a person who practices the skills of critical thinking or has been trained and educated in its disciplines.&#91;3&#93; Philosopher Richard W. Paul said that the mind of a critical thinker engages the person's intellectual abilities and personality traits.&#91;4&#93; Critical thinking presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use in effective communication and problem solving, and a commitment to overcome egocentrism and sociocentrism.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;
