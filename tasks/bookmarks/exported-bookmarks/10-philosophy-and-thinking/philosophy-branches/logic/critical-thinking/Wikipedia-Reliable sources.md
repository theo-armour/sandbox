## Excerpt

Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published sources, making sure that all majority and significant minority views that have appeared in those sources are covered (see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view).  If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.
