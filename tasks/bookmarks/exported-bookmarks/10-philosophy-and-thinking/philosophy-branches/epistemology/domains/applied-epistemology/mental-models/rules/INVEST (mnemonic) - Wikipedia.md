## Excerpt

The INVEST mnemonic for Agile software development projects was created by Bill Wake&#91;1&#93; as a reminder of the characteristics of a good quality Product Backlog Item (commonly written in user story format, but not required to be) or PBI for short.
Such PBIs may be used in a Scrum backlog, Kanban board or XP project.
