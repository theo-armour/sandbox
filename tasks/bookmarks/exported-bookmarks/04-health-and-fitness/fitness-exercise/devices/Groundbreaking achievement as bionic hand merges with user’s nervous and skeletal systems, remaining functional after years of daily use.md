## Excerpt

pstrongRevolutionizing Prosthetics: The long-term integration of a bionic hand into the user&rsquo;s nervous and skeletal systems has been reported as successful for the first time. A Swedish woman who lost her right hand in a farming accident was implanted with a novel human-machine interface into her residual bone, nerves, and muscles. The residual limb was surgically modified to better integrate with the bionic hand that uses A.I. to understand her commands. The study was published in the journal emScience Robotics/em and involved researchers in Sweden, Italy, and Australia./strong/p
