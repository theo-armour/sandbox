## Excerpt

One of the most outlandish Kickstarter projects of 2023 is about to spawn a product series meant to create a new breed of superhuman outdoor adventurer. The Hypershell Omega motored onto Kickstarter last March as a real wild card, a wearable set of AI-driven robo legs promising to give man the power of a horse in high-alpine environments in order to offset backpack weight, extend natural range and ease the journey. The campaign was a US$1 million success story, and now the Chinese startup is preparing to show its two latest refinements at CES 2024.
