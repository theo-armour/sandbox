## Excerpt

New study released by the Lancet shows that, in 2022, more than 1 billion people in the world are now living with obesity. Malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition, inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight and obesity. Undernutrition is responsible for half of the deaths of children under 5 and obesity can cause noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and some cancers.
