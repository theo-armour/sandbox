## Excerpt

The later addition to the building is a perfect metaphor for the typical problems
of software development. The building uses a colour scheme to indicate its different basic
structures, but the routers, being a recent addition, do not fit the scheme. Can we come up
with a way of building buildings and software that makes such large-scale adaptations
possible? What would a Centre Pompidou plan look like if it was supposed to accommodate the
late addition of new basic networks?
