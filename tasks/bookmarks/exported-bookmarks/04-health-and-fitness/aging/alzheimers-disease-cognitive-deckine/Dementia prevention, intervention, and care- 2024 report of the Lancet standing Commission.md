## Excerpt

The 2024 update of the Lancet Commission on dementia provides new hopeful evidence
about dementia prevention, intervention, and care. As people live longer, the number
of people who live with dementia continues to rise, even as the age-specific incidence
decreases in high-income countries, emphasising the need to identify and implement
prevention approaches. We have summarised the new research since the 2020 report of
the Lancet Commission on dementia, prioritising systematic reviews and meta-analyses
and triangulating findings from different studies showing how cognitive and physical
reserve develop across the life course and how reducing vascular damage (eg, by reducing
smoking and treating high blood pressure) is likely to have contributed to a reduction
in age-related dementia incidence.
