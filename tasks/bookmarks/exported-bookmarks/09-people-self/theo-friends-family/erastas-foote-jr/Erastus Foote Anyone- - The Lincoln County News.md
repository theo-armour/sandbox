## Excerpt

Dear Lincoln County News Staff and Readers, A Chicago researcher, I'm currently working on a project that includes Erastus Foote Jr., born in Wiscasset in 1851. After moving to Chicago in 1868, he opened the Dearborn Foundry Co. in 1873. Foote was president of this Chicago business until he retired and returned to Wiscasset in 1914. Upon his death in 1932, he was buried in Wiscasset. The Wood-Foote house remains standing in the town.
