## Excerpt

AN ATLANTIC PORT. Nov. 5.--A British liner arrived today from England with 225 passengers, making the trip within six days, which was a record for wartime. The ship in making fast to the pier this morning bumped the pierhead and tore away some of the superstructure with her sharp stem. There was delay in getting the baggage from the hold because the longshoremen insisted on a full hour for luncheon at noon.
