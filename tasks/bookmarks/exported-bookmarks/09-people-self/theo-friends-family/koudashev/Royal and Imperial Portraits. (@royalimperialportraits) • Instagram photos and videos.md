The aristocracy wore lavish, expensive 17th century costumes, in accordance with the theme of the ancient Muscovite court. Gold, pearls, diamonds, and silks were used. Princess Vera dressed as a boyarina; that is a noblewoman.

Not much is known about her life; she was born into the Nirod family and married Prince Kudashev, with whom she had two children. Her father died in 1914. Vera died in 1920 in Paris, at just 45 years old, followed by her husband in 1933 and her mother in 1940. It is very likely that they fled Russia after the 1917 revolution. Paris was a very common location for Russian émigrés.

Stripped of their titles and properties, Russian nobles and aristocrats in exile had to adapt to different circumstances. They sold whatever they still owned and worked normal jobs such as taxi drivers. The dignity and acceptance of many aristocratic families, both those who remained in Russia or fled, is exemplary. Those who remained in Russia under the violent Communist regime were marked as ‘former people’ and, like the rest of the regime’s ‘enemies’, were subjected to severe persecution: arbitrary arrests, surveillance, imprisonment, torture, and ‘executions’ were common.

Those who fled, although spared from the regime’s brutality, still suffered hardship in exile. Both groups adapted to the best of their ability. Most families remained united, continued to marry and raise children, and lived modestly, often in rundown apartments, with the utmost humility.their members still married and had children.

A great book on this subject is that of Douglas Smith, called ‘Former People: The Final Days of the Russian Aristocracy’. It is beautifully written and extremely well researched.".
