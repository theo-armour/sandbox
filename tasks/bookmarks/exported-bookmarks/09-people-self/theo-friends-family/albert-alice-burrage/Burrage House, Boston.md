## Excerpt

When built it was considered an "eyesore" and was the most controversial home in Boston!  	Built in 1899 for attorney Albert C. Burrage. It was home to the Burrage family until 1947. It got converted into doctor's offices, later it became the Boston Evening Clinic, later still it became a nursing home and is now condos!  	Similar to homes built on New York's Fifth Avenue, it was modeled after Chenonceaux, a chateau located in the Loire Valley of France, and represents the only example of the "chateauesque" style in Boston.  	 	This striking building was designed by Architect Charles Brigham, who also designed the additions to the State House and numerous other buildings in Boston.  	You can find this mansion on Commonwealth Ave at the corner of Hereford.
