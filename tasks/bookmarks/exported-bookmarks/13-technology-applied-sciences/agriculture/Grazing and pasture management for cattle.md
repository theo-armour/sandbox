## Excerpt

Benefits of grazing Cost The highest cost in most, if not all, cattle production systems is feed. Many producers use grazing to reduce costs for their operations. Properly managed pasture-based systems use land efficiently and provide high production per acre. Marginal land Not all land can grow row crops. These pieces of land are usually described as marginal.  Grazing is a way to grow a crop (grass) on land unsuitable for traditional row crops such as corn and beans. Cows can use the grass and make otherwise unproductive land productive.
