## Excerpt

Introduction This dataset contains detailed data on 42,207 apartments (242,257 rooms) in 3,093 buildings including their geometries, room typology as well as their visual, acoustical, topological and daylight characteristics. Procurement The data is sourced from commercial clients of Archilyse AG specializing on the digitization and analysis of buildings. The existing building plans of clients are converted into a geo-referenced, semantically annotated representation and undergo a manual Q/A process to ensure accuracy of the data and to ensure a maximum 5%-deviation in the apartments' areas (validated with a median deviation of 1.2%). Geometries The dataset contains a file geometries.csv which contains the geometries of all areas, walls, railings, columns, windows, doors and features (sinks, bathtubs, etc.) of an apartment. In total the datasets contains the 2D geometry of ~1.2 million separators (walls, railings), ~550,000 openings (windows, doors), ca. 400,000 areas (rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, etc.) and ~240,000 features (sinks, toilets, bathtubs, etc.). Each row contains: entity_type: The entity type (area, separator, opening, feature) entity_subtype: The entity’s sub type (e.g. WALL) geometry: The element’s geometry as a WKT geometry. The geometry is given in the site’s local coordinate system. I.e. the position between elements of the same site are correct in respect to each other. The +y direction points northwards, the +x direction points eastwards. area_id: The ID of the area in which the element is spatially contained (for features) unit_id: The ID of the unit in which the element is spatially contained (for features, areas) apartment_id: The ID of the apartment (for features, areas) floor_id: The ID of the floor building_id: The ID of the building site_id: The ID of the site An example: column   entity_type area entity_subtype ROOM geometry POLYGON ((-2.10406 4.02039… site_id 127 building_id 164 floor_id 12864 apartment_id d4438f2129b30290845ce7eef98a5ba7 unit_id 76643 area_id 684674 Simulations Beside the geometrical model, we also provide simulation data on the visual, acoustic, solar, layout and connectivity-related characteristics of the apartments. The file simulations.csv contains the simulation data aggregated on a per-area basis. Each row contains the identifier columns area_id, unit_id, apartment_id, floor_id, building_id, site_id as defined above as well as 367 simulation columns. Each simulation column is formatted as: simulation_category_simulation_dimensions_aggregation_function For instance. the column view_buildings_median describes the amount of building surface that can be seen from any point in a given room. The aggregation methods vary per simulation category and are described in detail below. Layout The layout features represent simple features based on the geometry and composition of a room, the dataset provides the following information in an unaggregated form. Area Basics / Geometry dimension description layout_area_type The area’s area type layout_net_area The area’s share of the apartment’s net area (e.g. 0 for a balcony) layout_area The area’s actual area layout_perimeter The area’s perimeter layout_compactness The area’s compactness (the Polsby–Popper score) layout_room_count The area’s share to the apartment’s room count layout_is_navigable True if the area is navigable by a wheelchair Area Features dimension description layout_has_sink True if the area has a sink layout_has_shower True if the area has a shower layout_has_bathtub True if the area has a bathtub layout_has_toilet True if the area has a toilet layout_has_stairs True if the area has stairs layout_has_entrance_door True if the area is directly leading to an exit of the apartment Area Windows / Doors dimension description layout_number_of_doors The number of doors directly leading to the area layout_number_of_windows The number of windows of the area layout_door_perimeter The sum of all door lengths directly leading to the area layout_window_perimeter The sum of all window lengths of the area Area Walls / Railings dimension description layout_open_perimeter The sum of all of the areas boundaries that are neither walls nor railings layout_railing_perimeter The sum of all of the areas boundaries that are railings layout_mean_walllengths The mean length of the area’s sides layout_std_walllengths The standard deviation of the lengths of the area’s sides Area Adjecency dimension description layout_connects_to_bathroom True if the area connects to a bathroom layout_connects_to_private_outdoor True if the area connects to an outside area that is private to the apartment View The views from an object help to understand the impact of the surroundings on the object. The view simulation calculates the visible amount of buildings, greenery, water etc. on each individual hexagon from the analyzed object. The values are expressed in steradians (sr) and represent the amount a certain object category occupies in the spherical field of view. Each of the following dimension is provided using the room-wise aggregations min, max, mean, std, median, p20 and p80. For instance, the column view_greenery_p20 describes the amount of greenery that can be seen from at least 20% of the positions in the area. dimension description view_buildings The amount of visible buildings view_greenery The amount of visible greenery view_ground The amount of visible ground view_isovist The amount of visible isovist view_mountains_class_2 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 2 view_mountains_class_3 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 3 view_mountains_class_4 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 4 view_mountains_class_5 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 5 view_mountains_class_6 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 6 view_railway_tracks The amount of visible railway_tracks view_site The amount of visible site view_sky The amount of visible sky view_tertiary_streets The amount of visible tertiary_streets view_secondary_streets The amount of visible secondary_streets view_primary_streets The amount of visible primary_streets view_pedestrians The amount of visible pedestrians view_highways The amount of visible highways view_water The amount of visible water Sun Sun simulations help to understand the impact of the solar radiation on the object. The outcome of the sun simulations helps to identify surfaces that have great solar potential. Sun simulations are defined by the amount of sun radiation on each individual hexagon from the analyzed object. The sun simulation not only includes direct sun but also considers scattered light. The sun simulation values are given in Kilolux (klx). Simulations are performed for the days of summer solstice, winter solstice and vernal equinox. Each of the following dimension is provided using the room-wise aggregations min, max, mean, std, median, p20 and p80. For instance, column sun_201806211200_median describes the median amount of direct daylight received on the positions in the area. Vernal Equinox dimension description sun_201803210800 Daylight at 08:00 on 21st of March sun_201803211000 Daylight at 10:00 on 21st of March sun_201803211200 Daylight at 12:00 on 21st of March sun_201803211400 Daylight at 14:00 on 21st of March sun_201803211600 Daylight at 16:00 on 21st of March sun_201803211800 Daylight at 18:00 on 21st of March Summer Solstice dimension description sun_201806210600 Daylight at 06:00 on 21st of June sun_201806210800 Daylight at 08:00 on 21st of June sun_201806211000 Daylight at 10:00 on 21st of June sun_201806211200 Daylight at 12:00 on 21st of June sun_201806211400 Daylight at 14:00 on 21st of June sun_201806211600 Daylight at 16:00 on 21st of June sun_201806211800 Daylight at 18:00 on 21st of June sun_201806212000 Daylight at 20:00 on 21st of June Winter Solstice dimension description sun_201812211000 Daylight at 10:00 on 21st of December sun_201812211200 Daylight at 12:00 on 21st of December sun_201812211400 Daylight at 14:00 on 21st of December sun_201812211600 Daylight at 16:00 on 21st of December Noise / Window Noise Noise level and the distribution of elements from an area helps to understand how an object is exposed to the acoustics of this area. The acoustic simulation calculates the noise intensity on each individual hexagon from the analyzed object considering traffic and train noise datasets. Adjacent buildings are considered as noise blocking elements. The values are expressed in dBA (decibels). Window Noise The noise per window of a given area is aggregated via min and max. For instance, window_noise_train_day_max represents the maximum amount of noise received on any window of the area. dimension description window_noise_traffic_day The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from daytime car traffic window_noise_traffic_night The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from night-time car traffic window_noise_train_day The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from daytime train traffic window_noise_train_night The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from night-time train traffic Area-Wise Noise The area-wise noise describes the amount of noise received from a noise source aggregated over the whole area in an unaggregated form. For instance, noise_traffic_night describes the dBA of noise received in the area from car traffic at night when propagating noise from all windows. dimension description noise_traffic_day The amount of noise received in the area from daytime car traffic noise_traffic_night The amount of noise received in the area from night-time car traffic noise_train_day The amount of noise received in the area from daytime train traffic noise_train_night The amount of noise received in the area from night-time train traffic Connectivity Centrality simulations help to analyze a floor plan, whether it’s a shopping mall and you want to identify prominent areas
