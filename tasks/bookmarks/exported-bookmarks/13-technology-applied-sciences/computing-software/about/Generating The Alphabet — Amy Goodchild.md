## Excerpt

My current generative artwork-in-progress makes use of text, but I wanted to avoid fonts. Using a “web safe” font could mean inconsistent results, while uploading a font would mean a large file size. Additionally, I didn’t want a visual element of the project to be something I didn’t create myself.
