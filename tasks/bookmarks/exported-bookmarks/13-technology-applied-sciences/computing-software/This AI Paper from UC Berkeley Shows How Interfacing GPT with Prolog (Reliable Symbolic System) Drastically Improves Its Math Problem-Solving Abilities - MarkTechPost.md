## Excerpt

The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). LLMs show human-level performance in many professional and academic fields, showing a great understanding of language rules and patterns. However, they often struggle with reasoning reliably and flexibly. This problem likely comes from the way transformers, the underlying architecture, work. They solve problems step-by-step, predicting the next word in a sequence, which limits their ability to backtrack and fix errors. Moreover, LLMs are trained statistically, which creates challenges in handling problems outside their training distribution. Recently, many works have highlighted the combining of
