## Excerpt

In this article, I will describe a recent addition to CSS, the font-size-adjust property. I am also
making a bold claim that everyone in the world misunderstands the usefulness of this property,
including Google,
MDN, and
CSS Specification itself.
(Just to clarify, no, I am not a web designer and I have no idea what I am talking about).
