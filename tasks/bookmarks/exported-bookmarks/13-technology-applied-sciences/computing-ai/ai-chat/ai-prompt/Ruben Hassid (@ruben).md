## Excerpt

Most people guess prompting.

But these prompts fix 80% of your needs:

To access my blog on 7 Sins of Prompting, go to: https://lnkd.in/duP3Za5W

1. Start with “Let’s think about this differently”

↳ It stops giving you generic answers.

↳ You get creative, out-of-the-box ideas.

2. Use “What am I not seeing here?”

↳ This finds blind spots and hidden assumptions.

↳ You get a wider, smarter view of your problem.

3. Say “Break this down for me”

↳ Even for simple things, this works.

↳ AI explains the steps, the science, and the why.

4. Ask “What would you do in my shoes?”

↳ AI stops being neutral and gives real opinions.

↳ You get advice that’s specific and actionable.

5. Use “Here’s what I’m really asking”

↳ Add this after your main question.

↳ You get answers that fit your true needs.

6. End with “What else should I know?”

↳ This is the secret weapon.

↳ You get a complete answer, not just a quick fix.
