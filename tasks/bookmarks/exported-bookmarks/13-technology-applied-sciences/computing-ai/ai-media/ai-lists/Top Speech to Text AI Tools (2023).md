## Excerpt

Intelligent transcription software is one of the most valuable features made possible by AI and ML since it automatically translates audio and video sources into text. This opens up a world of possibilities, including the ability to transcribe podcasts, films, meetings, online courses, and more. For computers to process, analyze, interpret, and reason about human language, a subfield of AI known as natural language processing (NLP) is required. This subfield is the foundation of AI transcription software and services. Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on methods from disciplines as diverse as linguistics and computer science.
