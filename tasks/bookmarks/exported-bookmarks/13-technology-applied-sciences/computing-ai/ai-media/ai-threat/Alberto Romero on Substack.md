## Excerpt

The 7 deadly sins of AI companies:

Pride: “No one else but us knows how to bring prosperity and abundance to this world. God appointed us to do his bidding, which is building a new god. We're the chosen ones.”

Greed: “To do it it's not enough being non-profit or prioritizing people. We need to tell you sci-fi stories about superintelligence while we increase our revenue with these things that are polluting the commons.”

Lust: “We monetized sex with PornHub; we monetized dating with Tinder; we’ll now monetize love and loneliness with Girlfriends, Inc. Tell her all your darkest desires.”

Envy: “Why can social media companies have all this data about users but we can’t? Let us remain as an anomalously unregulated space so we can collect all those juicy convos.”

Gluttony: “We need to feed the entire public internet—tons and tons of data created by you—into these giant models to make AI almost capable of making an excel spreadsheet.”

Wrath: “If you try to stop us from making this happen we will lobby the entire world, buy press companies, appoint national security experts, and establish a discourse that will compel your boss to replace you.”

Sloth: “A new efficient algorithm that wastes less electricity and water? No, not really urgent to build that. It’s better to lay down while these giant computers use up as many resources as they need to self-fulfill the prophecy of scale: more is always better.”
