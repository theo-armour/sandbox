## Excerpt

Or rather Samuel Hammond does. Tyler Cowen finds it interesting but not his view. I put up a market, and then started looking. Click through to his post for the theses. I will be quoting a few of them in full, but not most of them. I am not trying to be exact with these probabilities when the question calls for them, nor am I being super careful to make them consistent, so errors and adjustments are inevitable.
