## Excerpt

RL environments are the playgrounds where agents learn. Until now, they’ve been fragmented, closed, and hard to share. We are launching the Environments Hub to change that: an open, community-powered platform that gives environments a true home.Environments define the world, rules and feedback loop of state, action and reward. From games to coding tasks to dialogue, they’re the contexts where AI learns, without them, RL is just an algorithm with nothing to act on.
