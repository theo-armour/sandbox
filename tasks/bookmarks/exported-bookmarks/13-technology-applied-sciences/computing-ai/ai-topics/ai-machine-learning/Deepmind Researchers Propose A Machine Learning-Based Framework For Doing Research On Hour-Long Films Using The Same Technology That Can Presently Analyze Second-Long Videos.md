## Excerpt

Raw movies are massive and must be compressed before being saved on a disc; once loaded, they are decompressed and placed in device memory before being used as inputs to neural networks. Because vision pipelines do not scale well beyond that point, most computer vision research focuses on short time scales of two to ten seconds at 25fps (frames-per-second). In this context, and with present technology, training models on minute-long raw films might require excessive time or physical memory. Loading such films onto GPU or TPU may become impractical, as it necessitates decompression and transmission, frequently over bandwidth-limited network infrastructure.
