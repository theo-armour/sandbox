## Excerpt

An individual's personality consists of a unique combination of qualities, characteristics, and ways of thinking. It shapes our most fundamental social interactions and preferences due to our shared biological and environmental histories. Due to their extensive exposure to human-generated data during training, LLMs can convincingly portray human-like personas in their outputs and, in effect, demonstrate a synthetic personality. Due to their extensive exposure to human-generated data during training, LLMs can convincingly portray human-like personas in their outputs and, in effect, demonstrate a synthetic personality. Recent research has attempted to identify unintended consequences of LLMs' enhanced abilities, such as the tendency
