## Excerpt

Imagine you programmed a language model (LM) to perform basic data analysis on the drug and medical histories. You would require labeled data for training your machine-learning model, including data from various patient histories. Building a large labeled dataset is quite difficult. It would require manual labeling with domain experts, which is cost-prohibitive. How would you deal with these models? Researchers at Stanford University, Anthropic, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison tackle it by designing language models to learn the annotation tasks in context and replace manual labeling at scale. LMs in-context capabilities enable the model to remember tasks from the
