## Excerpt

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and advanced, adding a new level of complexity to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Through intensive training methods, these models have mastered some amazing Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, and Natural Language Generation tasks such as answering questions, comprehending natural language inference, and summarising material. They have also accomplished activities that are not commonly associated with NLP, such as grasping human intent and executing instructions. Applications like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and AgentGPT, which use LLMs to achieve autonomous goals, have been made possible thanks to all NLP advancements. Though these approaches have generated a
