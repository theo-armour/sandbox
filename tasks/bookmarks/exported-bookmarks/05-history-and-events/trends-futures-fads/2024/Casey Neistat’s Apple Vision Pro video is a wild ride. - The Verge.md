## Excerpt

Now that Apple’s “spatial computing” headset is officially out in the world, we’re already starting to see some truly surreal (and wildly entertaining) content. Easily my favorite so far is Casey Neistat’s new video, which sees him taking the Vision Pro through the streets of New York City, onto the subway, and into the heart of Times Square. The reactions are everything. I burst out laughing at the 3:43 mark, when Casey freezes in the middle of the subway staircase to respond to a text message — using only his eyes and fingers, of course. (Everyone, please: don’t wear this thing while controlling any type of transportation.)
