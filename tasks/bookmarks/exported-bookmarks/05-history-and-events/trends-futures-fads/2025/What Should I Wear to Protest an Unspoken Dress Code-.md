## Highlights

Highlight:If you want it to go further, however, and you don’t want what you wear to become the dominant topic of conversation whenever you walk into a room, there is a simple way to turn a fashion choice into a form of protest. Create a uniform for yourself that stands out simply because it is different from the uniform of the majority. (Honestly, this is one of the lessons of high school.)Wear any garment consistently, and at some point everyone else should get the message. Whether they are aware of it or not.
