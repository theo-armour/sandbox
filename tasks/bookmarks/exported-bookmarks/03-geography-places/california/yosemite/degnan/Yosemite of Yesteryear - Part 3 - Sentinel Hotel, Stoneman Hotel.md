## Excerpt

Originally, Yosemite was visited by arriving on horseback or (later) by stagecoach. This series of posts will reveal details of the early buildings in and around the valley; where they were, who ran them, what was around them. In this post, we’ll learn about the Sentinel Hotel, Yosemite Chapel, Stoneman House and Camp Curry (now “Half Dome Village)
