## Excerpt

We’re building the founding engineering team at Adam.
At Adam, we’re tackling a frontier problem: building a new way to interface with CAD via AI. This demands creativity, deep technical ability, and novel thinking.
As part of the founding engineering team you may:
Sprint for two weeks to build a new product vertical from scratch 
Develop new interfaces for AI-driven CAD workflows
Design, implement, test, and deploy full features 
Work with our product team to ensure a fast, consistent, and beautiful experience across the application
We are looking for people who:
Blend excellent engineering with a taste for models and design
Have previously built a great product
Operate with high agency and own problems end-to-end
At Adam, you will be given the autonomy to do some of the best work of your life and redefine how the physical world is built.
