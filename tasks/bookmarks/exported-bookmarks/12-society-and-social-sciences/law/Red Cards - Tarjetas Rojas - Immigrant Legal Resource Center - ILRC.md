## Excerpt

All people in the United States, regardless of immigration status, have certain rights and protections under the U.S. Constitution. The ILRC’s Red Cards help people assert their rights and defend themselves in many situations, such as when ICE agents go to a home. Special thanks to our many partners who contributed translations in the various languages now available, making these red cards accessible to more individuals.
