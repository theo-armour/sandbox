What coding tools to rely on primarily?

The current dilemma is whether to use the different command line interfaces such as Codex, Gemini, Anthracite, or Claude Code or to continue learning to do all of these things within the VSCode interface.

My current thinking is that I will be switching back and forth between the different Fender's products. So it's more important for me to consider my base tool, which is VS Code.
The benefit to that is that I can use the tricks that I use in VSCode to help my regular English writing and other task management things that I do.

At the same time, it would be nice to figure out some of the command-line interface aspects as well. But then that also means Node and Python.

So in some ways, what I'm looking for is that the command-line interface handles all that stuff in the cloud, and I don't have to do it locally.
